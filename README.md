# httpoizn

httpoizn is a Python tool for detecting HTTP Host & Header Poisoning vulnerabilities. It works by injecting randomized canaries into common HTTP headers and analyzes responses for reflections or meaningful differences.

## ‚ú® Features

* Canary-based poisoning detection (host & IP canaries).
* Supports custom canaries (--canary, --ip-canary).
* Reflection analysis in both response body and headers.
* Baseline comparison to catch subtle changes.
* Simple CLI with Typer subcommands.
* Color-coded output for easy triage.*

```sh
httpoizn run -u <url>
```

Examples:

```sh
httpoizn run -u https://target.com               # Run with random canaries
httpoizn run -u https://target.com -c mycanary   # Specify custom host canary
httpoizn run -u https://target.com -i 6.6.6.6    # Specify custom IP canary
httpoizn version                                 # Show version
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Example Output
```
[+] Using host canary: z9hvgimj
[+] Using IP canary: 177.63.225.63
[-] No poisoning with header Host
[-] No poisoning with header X-Host
[+] Potential poisoning detected with header X-Forwarded-For

[+] Summary of poisoned responses:
  Header: X-Forwarded-For
    - Canary reflected in RESPONSE BODY
